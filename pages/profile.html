        <h1>About me</h1>
        <article id="profile_text">
            <h3>Me and what i do</h3>
            <p>My name is Boaz Vaneveld.
                I am 20 years old and have been living in Middelburg all my life.
                I love animals and my house is home to several pets, although not all of them belong to me.
                I have a couple of hobbies! I have a bit more time for some than others but it's difficult to fit everything you want to do into your life.
            </p>
            <ul class="profile_hobby_list">
                <li>Archery. I have practiced archery for quite some time, but i unfortunately had to stop. I wasn't the best but i had fun doing it and that's what counts right? My time practicing this sport will always be a fond memory.</li>
                <li>Badminton. One of my more recent endeavors trying to find a sport that suits me. This was quite a lot of fun! Of course the mandatory warm-ups always had to spoil the fun.</li>
                <li>Chess. Quite a few years i have been playing chess now, but always only once a month or less. I never got all that good at it but the people around me are even worse, so i still win a lot!</li>
                <li>Writing. This is hobby i spent the most amount of time on. I hope to one day publish a book of my very own! It sure is difficult though, i have to plan out my entire story before i even start to write it!</li>
                <li>Drawing. I like to draw when i'm bored, which isn't all that often surprisingly. Still, i like what i put on the pages and it's a good outlet for my creativity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Higher and lower education</h3>
            <p>When i finshed my VWO TTO high school education i had quite a bit of trouble deciding what i wanted to study. Eventually i had to make a decision and i think i choose correctly.
                I am currently a student at the HZ University in Middelburg. I am studying HBO-ICT in order to become a programmer.
                This study is some of my only experience programming so it introduces quite a lot of new concepts at once. Luckily, i managed to keep up and i even made this very website you're reading!
                Speaking of which, you are most likely reading all of this using my GitHub page aren't you? You can find my most important projects on <a href="https://github.com/BoazVaneveld">my GitHub page.</a>
